# AIRLINES-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger 
reservations and ticket records. This project is aimed at exposing the relevance and importance 
of Airline Reservation Systems. After entering the details such as name, address, city, state and 
contact number, the system books the flight and update both airline database and user database. 
The system also allows cancelation. It is projected towards upgrading the connection among 
clients and aircraft organizations using ARSs, and subsequently making it advantageous for the 
clients to book the trips as when they require. It saves the time of the customer when booking 
tickets
